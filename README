Program's description:
	FET means "Free Evolutionary Timetabling (software)".
	This program aims to automatically generate the timetable of a university,
	school or high-school, in an evolutionary manner.
	
Requirements:
	FET is created in the following environment: Slackware 10.0 GNU/Linux distribution,
	KDevelop 3.1.2, Qt 3.3.2, gcc 3.3.4, Linux 2.4.26, other great free tools.
	
	Software: gcc 3.3.4 or similar, Qt 3.3.2 ("./configure -thread") or compatible.

Download:
	You can download the latest version from http://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/ (for now).
	Older versions: you will have to contact the author if you are interested.

Compiling:
	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:
	- You will need Qt 3.3.2 or compatible to compile this program.
	IMPORTANT: Qt must be configured with thread support: "./configure -thread".
	- if the Makefile is not working, please erase it. There should be
	one in the root directory ("/.../fet-x.x.x/").
	- if the Makefile is not available or you erased it, type "qmake fet.pro".
	- type "make"
	To remove the compiled objects/executable: "make clean" and/or "make distclean".
	
	Microsoft Windows: you will have to download and install Qt from trolltech.com.
	E-mail me for details.
	
Installing:
	GNU/Linux and similar OS's:	
	Please move the whole directory "fet-x.x.x" into the place where you like,
	for instance to the directory "/usr/local/".

Running:
	Run the executable named "/.../fet-x.x.x/fet" (x.x.x is the version).
	
	You can change various parameters in the file "~/.fet/fet.ini" (home 
	directory, in .fet/fet.ini)
	(yes, please play with them, try greater population size, etc.)
	
Documentation:
	Very primitive: some hints in the directory "/.../fet-x.x.x/doc/".
	If you are a programmer and would like to know how the program works,
	you can use "doxygen" to generate API documentation.

Input files:
	You can open a few sample input files in "/.../fet-x.x.x/sample_inputs/" directory.
	
	You can create/modify a file from FET's user interface or you can modify it by
	hand, if you like (there should be no problems, but please make as many backups
	as you can).

Feed-back / help:
	- I would like to hear your oppinions/results about this program; any
	feed-back would be greatly appreciated.
	- Reporting bugs/wishes/patches: for now, to the author.
	
	This project is free software, so any sponsoring offer/donation would be great. You can 
	contact	the author for that.
