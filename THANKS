[4] Z.Michalewicz, Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs (2nd ed.),
Springer-Verlag, 1994 (not free. I cannot say whether it is worth the money, but it 
helped me understand some important concepts. This was a borrowed book and I never had the
opportunity to read other expensive books on genetic algorithms, to compare them).

I will have to add here other great free sources of information I found on the web,
but these were the most useful ones.


People who helped me (chronologically)
--------------------------------------

Costin Badica	- my teacher, who helped me a lot. He actually made
		me begin this project and provided me documentation and advices.

Carsten Niehaus - suggestions.

Imre Nagy 	- e-mail list (does not work anymore), suggestions.

Sajith V. K. - suggestions
		- suggested the idea to implement ConstraintActivitiesSameTime
		- suggested the two tricks to allow more teachers or subgroups per activity (now deprecated)
		- a user's guide (now deprecated)

Michael Towers	- lots of bugs reported, sample files, suggestions, front/back-end.

Antti Leppik	- sample file, suggestions.

Ian Fantom	- sample file, suggestions.

Simon Ghetti	- sample files, suggestions.

Gibbon Tamba - sample file, bug reported.

Jerome Durand - bug reported, French translation (fetfr@free.fr, please also see http://fetfr.free.fr).

Marek Jaszuk - bugs reported, suggestions.

Ramanathan Srinivasan - suggested Constraint2ActivitiesConsecutive and Constraint2ActivitiesGrouped.

Vimal Joseph - suggested ConstraintActivitiesPreferredTimes;
		- a script to convert the .xml results into .tex.

Cristian Gherman - bug reported when working in another language and saving constraints
				- suggested the possibility to add more than 3 teachers and 4 students
				sets per activity - you can do that by modifying the .xml input file
				by hand.
				
Nicholas Robinson - suggested that when the program exits, the user to have the possibility
			of saving the working file.
				  - suggested ConstraintTeacherRequiresRoom.
				  - other suggestions.

Radu Spineanu - debian package.

Morten Piil	- bug reported, sample file.

Sebastian Canagaratna - suggestions.

All the above users were alpha-testers.
