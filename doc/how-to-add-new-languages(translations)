FET - How to add new translations (languages)
---------------------------------------------

STEP 1.

Modify the file "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/interface.pro", by adding a line
in the TRANSLATIONS section for each language (for instance, adding
a backslash after the last translation and then "fet_it.ts" for italian).

STEP 2.

Enter the directory "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/" and type "lupdate interface.pro".
This will create the needed file, named "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts".

STEP 3.

Open the file "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts" (for example, fet_it.ts)
with the Qt Linguist and edit it, then save it.

IMPORTANT:
	Please do not modify the fields "WHOLE YEAR" and "WHOLE GROUP"
	in the QObject category. They must remain marked as "unfinished" -
	with a question mark. This is a delicate issue and I do not know
	how to solve it in an elegant manner.
	More recently: you must translate "WHOLE YEAR" by "WHOLE YEAR"
	and "WHOLE GROUP" by "WHOLE GROUP". This might be a temporary solution.

STEP 4.

From Qt Linguist, release the translation as "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.qm"
(for instance, fet_it.qm).

STEP 5.

Send all the three modified files to the author (for now). You will be added 
as a contributor, of course.


Current stage of the translation:

English and Romanian done by Liviu Lalescu (liviu@lalescu.ro).
French translation done by Jerome Durand. Public e-mail is fetfr@free.fr.
	Please check also http://fetfr.free.fr.
Fresta Alfio (trecyman77@email.it) said that he was willing to translate FET into Italian.

Of course, anyone can redo/improve current translations. The best variants will be chosen.
