FET - How to add new translations (languages)
---------------------------------------------

STEP 1.

Modify the file "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/interface.pro", by adding a line
in the TRANSLATIONS section for each language (for instance, adding
a backslash after the last translation and then "fet_it.ts" for italian).

STEP 2.

Enter the directory "fet-x.x.x/src/interface/" and type "lupdate interface.pro".
This will create the needed file, named "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts".

STEP 3.

Open the file "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.ts" (for example, fet_it.ts)
with the Qt Linguist and edit it, then save it.

You do not have to translate all the fields. For instance, the FAQ
is very large. Just leave the corresponding fields marked as unfinished.

STEP 4.

From Qt Linguist, release the translation as "fet-x.x.x/translations/fet_**.qm"
(for instance, fet_it.qm).

STEP 5.

Send all the three modified files to the author (for now). You will be added 
as a contributor, of course.


Current stage of the translation:

Romanian translation done by Liviu Lalescu (liviu@lalescu.ro, http://lalescu.ro/liviu/).
French translation done by Jerome Durand (fetfr@free.fr, http://fetfr.free.fr/).
Catalan translation done by Miguel Gea Milvaques.

Of course, anyone can redo/improve current translations. The best variants will be chosen.
